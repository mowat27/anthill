# Instrumentation

## Progress Reporting

Handlers report progress via the `Runner`:

```python
@app.handler
def my_step(runner: Runner, state: State) -> State:
    runner.report_progress("doing work")
    return {**state, "result": "done"}
```

The `Runner` delegates to the `Channel`, which formats and outputs the message based on its implementation:

- **CliChannel**: Writes to stdout with format `[workflow_name, run_id] message`
- **ApiChannel**: Writes to stdout with format `[workflow_name, run_id] message` (appears in server logs)
- **SlackChannel**: Posts to Slack thread via httpx sync POST with format `[workflow_name, run_id] message`
- **TestChannel**: Appends to `progress_messages` list for verification

## Error Reporting

Report non-fatal errors (informational warnings) via `runner.report_error()`:

```python
runner.report_error("optional validation failed, continuing")
```

For fatal errors, use `runner.fail()`:

```python
if "required_key" not in state:
    runner.fail("Missing required_key in state")
```

`fail()` raises `WorkflowFailedError` with the message. The CLI catches this exception, prints to stderr, and exits with code 1. API channels log the error and allow the server to continue. SlackChannel posts error messages to the thread with `[ERROR]` prefix: `[workflow_name, run_id] [ERROR] message`.

## Run Identification

Every workflow execution gets a unique `run_id` (8-character hex string). The `Runner` injects it into state along with `workflow_name`:

```python
state = {
    **channel.initial_state,
    "run_id": runner.id,
    "workflow_name": runner.workflow_name
}
```

Progress and error messages include the `run_id` for correlation.

## State Persistence

The framework automatically persists state as JSON on every change. State files are created in `app.state_dir` (default `.antkeeper/state/`) and named `{timestamp}-{run_id}.json` to match log file naming.

### Configuration

```python
app = App(state_dir=".antkeeper/state/")  # custom directory
app = App()                              # defaults to ".antkeeper/state/"
```

### Persistence Points

The `Runner` writes state to disk at three points:
1. **Initial state creation** - After injecting `run_id` and `workflow_name` but before handler execution
2. **After each workflow step** - When using `run_workflow()`, state is persisted after each step completes
3. **Final state** - After the handler returns successfully

Each write overwrites the file with the latest state snapshot (one file per run).

### State File Format

State files contain valid JSON with `indent=2` for readability:

```json
{
  "run_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "workflow_name": "my_workflow",
  "result": "done"
}
```

State file stems match log file stems for correlation: `20260207143000-a1b2c3d4.json` pairs with `20260207143000-a1b2c3d4.log`.

### Error Handling

If a handler raises an exception, the state file contains the last successfully persisted state (typically the initial state). If state contains non-JSON-serializable values, `json.dump` raises `TypeError` - this is a handler bug, not a framework error.

## Logging

The framework provides file-based Python logging via the `Runner`. Each workflow run creates a dedicated log file.

### Configuration

```python
app = App(log_dir="my/logs/")  # custom directory
app = App()                     # defaults to "agents/logs/"
```

### Per-Run Log Files

`Runner.__init__` creates a log file at `{log_dir}/{YYYYMMDDhhmmss}-{run_id}.log` with format:

```
2026-02-07 14:30:00,123 [INFO] antkeeper.run.a1b2c3d4 - Workflow started: my_workflow
```

The framework logs lifecycle events (runner init, workflow start/complete), handler execution (step names, state keys), and errors at INFO/DEBUG/ERROR levels. Log output does not leak to stdout/stderr (logger propagation is disabled).

### Using the Logger in Handlers

Handlers can access `runner.logger` for custom logging:

```python
@app.handler
def my_step(runner: Runner, state: State) -> State:
    runner.logger.info("Starting work")
    runner.logger.debug(f"State: {state}")
    return {**state, "done": True}
```

### Module-Level Loggers

Module-level loggers exist in `cli.py`, `channels/cli.py`, `channels/slack.py`, and `llm/claude_code.py`. These only produce output if a user configures handlers on them or their parents — they serve as extension points for additional logging.

## LLM Agent Execution

The `ClaudeCodeAgent` provides flexible configuration for invoking the Claude CLI:

```python
from antkeeper.llm.claude_code import ClaudeCodeAgent

# Basic usage with model selection
agent = ClaudeCodeAgent(model="claude-opus-4")

# Skip permissions prompts (yolo mode)
agent = ClaudeCodeAgent(yolo=True)

# Pass arbitrary CLI arguments
agent = ClaudeCodeAgent(opts=["--verbose", "--max-tokens", "4096"])

# Combine options (opts override convenience params)
agent = ClaudeCodeAgent(model="sonnet", yolo=True, opts=["--fast"])
```

### Constructor Parameters

- **model** (`str | None`): Model identifier passed as `--model` flag. If None, uses CLI default.
- **yolo** (`bool`): When True, passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to skip permission prompts.
- **opts** (`list[str] | None`): Arbitrary CLI arguments. When opts contains a flag that matches a convenience param (e.g., `--model`), the opts version takes precedence.

### Error Handling

The agent reports subprocess execution failures via `AgentExecutionError`:

```python
try:
    response = agent.prompt("/specify build a feature")
except AgentExecutionError as e:
    runner.fail(f"Agent failed: {e}")
```

No automatic retry or telemetry. Handlers are responsible for error handling policy.

## Git Integration

The `antkeeper.git` module provides git utilities for workflow execution, including low-level command execution, branch operations, and worktree isolation.

### Git Command Execution

The `git.core` module provides low-level command execution:

```python
from antkeeper.git import execute, GitCommandError

# Execute any git command (git prefix is auto-prepended if missing)
output = execute(["status"])
output = execute(["log", "--oneline", "-n", "5"])

# Explicit prefix still works
output = execute(["git", "status"])

# Raises GitCommandError on non-zero exit
try:
    execute(["checkout", "nonexistent-branch"])
except GitCommandError as e:
    runner.fail(f"Git command failed: {e}")
```

The `execute()` function:
- Automatically prepends `"git"` if not present; accepts commands with or without the prefix
- Returns stripped stdout on success
- Raises `GitCommandError` with stderr on failure
- Logs commands at debug level via `antkeeper.git.core` logger
- Returns empty string for successful commands with no output

**Design principle**: No input validation for impossible scenarios. The function delegates directly to `subprocess.run()`, which naturally handles edge cases like empty command lists. This follows the framework philosophy of avoiding validation for scenarios that can't happen in practice.

### Branch Operations

The `git.branch` module provides high-level branch utilities:

```python
from antkeeper.git import current

# Get current branch name
branch_name = current()  # "main", "feat/new-feature", or "HEAD" (detached)
```

The `current()` function:
- Returns current branch name or "HEAD" if in detached HEAD state
- Delegates to `execute(["rev-parse", "--abbrev-ref", "HEAD"])`
- Propagates `GitCommandError` on failure

### Worktree Configuration

```python
app = App(worktree_dir="trees/")  # custom directory
app = App()                        # defaults to "trees/"
```

Access the configured worktree directory via `runner.app.worktree_dir`.

### Worktree Class

The `Worktree` class wraps git worktree subprocess operations:

```python
from antkeeper.git import Worktree, WorktreeError

wt = Worktree(base_dir=runner.app.worktree_dir, name="20260207-a1b2c3d4")
wt.create(branch="feat/new-feature")  # Creates worktree with new branch
# wt.path is absolute, safe after cwd changes
wt.remove()  # Removes worktree
```

All paths are stored as absolute (`os.path.realpath`) so they remain valid after `os.chdir()`.

### git_worktree Context Manager

The `git_worktree` context manager guarantees cwd restoration via try/finally:

```python
from antkeeper.git import git_worktree, Worktree, WorktreeError

wt = Worktree(base_dir=runner.app.worktree_dir, name="feature-work")

# Create, enter, and clean up
with git_worktree(wt, create=True, branch="feat/x", remove=True):
    # Work inside worktree - cwd is wt.path
    state = run_workflow(runner, state, [step1, step2])
# Worktree is removed, cwd is restored

# Enter existing worktree
with git_worktree(wt, create=False):
    # Work inside existing worktree
    pass
# cwd restored, worktree kept
```

Key guarantees:
- **Cwd restoration**: `os.chdir()` back to original directory in finally block
- **Error propagation**: Git failures raise `WorktreeError` with stderr
- **Cleanup safety**: Removal happens after cwd restoration (not while inside worktree)
- **Validation**: Raises `WorktreeError` if `create=False` and worktree doesn't exist

Cwd changes are process-wide. The context manager is designed for single-threaded execution.

### Worktree Naming Pattern

Follow the log file naming convention for correlation:

```python
worktree_name = f"{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}-{runner.id}"
# Example: "20260207143000-a1b2c3d4"
```

This allows matching worktrees to their log files via the run_id.

### Error Handling

Git operations raise specific exceptions based on their failure domain:

- **GitCommandError** - Raised by `execute()` and propagates through `current()`. Indicates a git command failed with non-zero exit code.
- **WorktreeError** - Raised by `Worktree` class methods and `git_worktree` context manager. Indicates worktree-specific failures.

These exceptions are intentionally separate to represent different failure domains:

```python
from antkeeper.git import GitCommandError, WorktreeError

# Handle command execution failures
try:
    execute(["checkout", "nonexistent"])
except GitCommandError as e:
    runner.fail(f"Git command failed: {e}")

# Handle worktree operation failures
try:
    wt.create(branch="feat/x")
except WorktreeError as e:
    runner.fail(f"Worktree creation failed: {e}")
```

The framework does not catch these errors. Handlers are responsible for error policy.
