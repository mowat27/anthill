"""Test suite for the Antkeeper workflow framework.

This package contains unit and integration tests for the Antkeeper core framework,
CLI, and channels. Tests follow the project's testing rules: each test owns its
setup, I/O is replaced at boundaries, and tests exercise framework behavior rather
than application logic.
