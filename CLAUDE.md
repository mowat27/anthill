# Antkeeper Framework

Workflow engine written in Python.

* `uv` for building and running
* `ruff` linter
* `ty` typechecking
* Fast API + uvicorn webserver

**Slack is a first-class citizen**: All Slack functionality is a core part of the framework, not an optional extra. Treat it the same as CLI or API channels.
