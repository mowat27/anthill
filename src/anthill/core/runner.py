"""Workflow execution engine.

The Runner is the core execution engine that brings together an App (handler
registry) and a Channel (I/O boundary). It manages the workflow lifecycle:
- Generates unique run IDs
- Sets up per-run file logging
- Injects run_id and workflow_name into state
- Invokes workflow handlers
- Provides progress/error reporting utilities
- Handles workflow failures

Each Runner instance represents a single workflow execution.
